# Raw and Processed Data

This folder contains both my raw data and processed data for my analysis. Instructions for both uploading raw data and clean / wrangling / exploring / analyzing the data can be found in the "code" folder.

## Raw Data

Raw UOWN data is located in the "raw_data" folder and is titled "UOWN_data_master_spring2021 (2)". Both versions of the file are the same, except one is a .csv file and the other is a .xlsx file. This allows for reading in the data in either format.

## Processed data:

The following is a list of processed data files from the "processingscript.R" file.

1. B_BS_Con: Linear Model of biological score and conductivity in the BICO data set.

2. B_BS_ECFU: Linear Model of biological score and E. coli cfu in the BICO data set.

3. B_BS_Con: Linear Model of biological score and nitrate concentration in the BICO data set.

4. B_BS_Con: Linear Model of biological score and turbidity in the BICO data set.

5. BICO: Cleaned data frame for the BICO site.

6. B_BS_Con: Linear Model of biological score and conductivity in the MIDO data set.

7. B_BS_ECFU: Linear Model of biological score and E. coli cfu in the MIDO data set.

8. B_BS_Con: Linear Model of biological score and nitrate concentration in the MIDO data set.

9. B_BS_Con: Linear Model of biological score and turbidity in the MIDO data set.

10. MIDO: Cleaned data frame for the BICO site.

11. B_BS_Con: Linear Model of biological score and conductivity in the NORO data set.

abstract = {Aquatic ecosystems are at risk of being impaired by various organic chemicals, however comprehensive large-scale evaluations of waterbodies' status and trends are rare. Here, surface water monitoring data, gathered as part of the EU Water Framework Directive and comprising the occurrence of 352 organic contaminants (>8.3 mil. measurements; 2001–2015; 8213 sites) in 31 European countries, was used to evaluate past and current environmental risks for three aquatic species groups: fish, invertebrates, plants. Monitoring quality indices were defined per country and found to improve over time. Relationships became apparent between countries' monitoring quality index and their success in detecting contaminants. Across the EU, contaminants were more frequently found in recent years. Overall, 35.7% (n = 17,484) of sites exceeded at least one acute regulatory threshold level (RTL) each year, and average risks significantly increased over time for fish ($\tau$ = 0.498, p = 0.01) and aquatic invertebrates ($\tau$ = 0.429, p = 0.03). This indicates an increased chemical pressure to Europe's waterbodies and overall large-scale threshold exceedances. Pesticides were identified as the main risk drivers (>85% of RTL exceedances) with aquatic invertebrates being most acutely at risk in Europe. Agricultural land-use was clearly identified as the primary spatial driver of the observed aquatic risks throughout European surface waters. Issues in monitoring data heterogeneity were highlighted and also followed by subsequent improvement recommendations, strengthening future environmental quality assessments. Overall, aquatic ecosystem integrity remains acutely at risk across Europe, signaling the demand for continued improvements.},

abstract = {A healthy aquatic ecosystem plays an important role in the operation of nature and the survival of human beings. Understanding the mechanism of its interaction with the habitat process is conducive to formulating targeted ecological recovery plans. In this study, fish and macroinvertebrates were collected from 49 investigation sites in the Weihe River basin, China, during periods of the summer and the autumn of 2017. Cluster analysis and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) were used to analyze the similarity of community distribution of fish and macroinvertebrates and their response to environmental variables. The biological integrity index of fish (F-IBI) and benthic-macroinvertebrate (B-IBI) was introduced to evaluate the aquatic ecological health. The results showed that fish communities were more coherent than macroinvertebrate communities. The distinguished response to ecological factors was identified for fish and macroinvertebrates. The ecological factors of total nitrogen, conductivity and river width have significant effects on both fish and macroinvertebrate communities. In addition, the fish community was significantly influenced by chlorine, fluorine, pH and flow velocity, while the macroinvertebrate community was significantly influenced by bicarbonate and water depth. The differences in community structure and response to ecological factors between communities were amplified in their environmental quality scores. Although F-IBI and B-IBI tend to be consistent temporally, the correlation is not significant. B-IBI showed decreasing gradient of ecological health status in the downstream area, while F-IBI tended to be different across river systems, which further illustrated the differences in the response of fish and macroinvertebrates to environmental variables.},

@article{Boulton1999,
abstract = {1. Philosophically, the term 'river health' is useful because it is readily interpreted by the general public and evokes societal concern about human impacts on rivers. The common goal of achieving healthy rivers unites ecologists and the general public because the value of the ecologists' contributions is clear (and, hence, funded). The difficulty arises in the choice of relevant symptoms because there is a wide variety that can be measured with varying accuracy at a broad range of spatial scales. These indicators may respond to impacts at different time scales, and no single indicator is a 'silver bullet' that reveals river health unequivocally. 2. In practice, choice of indicator often shows personal bias, technical considerations, and constraints of knowledge. Selection of appropriate spatial and temporal scales for these measures is crucial. Although most measurements are spot samples (e.g. concentration, abundance, species richness), assessment of river health based on changes in ecological processes such as post-disturbance recovery rate or nutrient spiralling lengths may be more suitable in some cases. 3. Problems include validation of the indicator, its response time at a range of scales, and the reliability of its measurement. Assessment of river health should be accurate, timely (warning of deterioration instead of waiting until the patient is terminal), rapid (so that the response is swift), and inexpensive. The connectedness of running waters with their floodplains and catchments must be explicitly recognized. Hydrological and geomorphological modifications of rivers usually affect their health by severing or impairing the linkages, and the 'cure' may lie in addressing these causes. Often, we need landscape-level data for management because this is the scale where cumulative effects of impacts are evident. 4. The prognosis is uncertain. We need to explore further the use of integrative measures of river health, and focus on establishing a link between the measure and impaired ecological integrity. Ecosystem-level variables (e.g. estimates of production or respiration) show promise and recent technological advances make these more accessible. Data analytical approaches (e.g. multimetric vs. predictive models) need further debate but must not overlook the importance of high quality and relevant input data. Appropriate choice of indicators, rigorous sampling and analysis, and careful data interpretation must be matched with effective communication to policy-makers and the public. When this occurs, the concept of 'river health' becomes more than just a rhetorical tool.},

abstract = {Biomonitoring is a significant method for evaluating aquatic life forms and their environments. The longer the process continues, the results of it become more precise. Benthic macroinvertebrates' exposure to changes in environmental conditions makes them an important part of any biomonitoring program. This paper reviews a long-term water quality of the Buyuk Menderes River Basin which is the biggest river basin spread across the western Anatolia (Turkey). The study area was divided into three regions (Usak, Aydin, Denizli), primarily considering the provincial borders in the basin. A total of 40 sampling sites from the main river and its tributaries were selected. The prominent agricultural and industrial pollutants (textile, tannery and sugar factories) from each region have been taken into account. The most common and current biotic indices (BMWP Spanish version, ASPT, RBPIII, MMIF, EPT%, Diversity and Evenness) based on the pollution tolerance of benthic macroinvertebrates have been used to track water quality changes. The relationships between environmental variables (sO2, dO2, water temp., salinity, flow, TDS, Cond, pH, NO3-N, NO2-N, PO4-P, Fe+3, NH4-N) and bioindicators have been revealed by using multivariate analyses (NMDS, CCA). The region-based variations in water quality were compared with the Kruskal-Wallis test. The one-way variance analysis test (ANOVA) was used for the contrast between the biotic indices. Significant differences (p < 0.05) were found among the regions in terms of Shannon-Wiener, Evenness, BMWP and MMIF indices. Regions were separated according to pollution sources, and the impact of provinces on water quality may vary according to their industry types. It has been observed that pollutants can spread across a basin for very long distances and reinstatement of the environmental conditions may require long periods.},

This is particularly important in areas that have suffered from a significant impact of human pressure on the ecological status of water. Field studies were conducted in the Ruda River in an area that had undergone anthropogenic disturbances. The objectives of our survey were to test the biological metrics based on benthic macroinvertebrates at four study sites. Spring and autumn surveys of benthic invertebrates indicated that based on the BMWP and BMWP(PL) indices, water quality was higher in comparison with the value of Multimetric index at all of the sites that were studied. Our results revealed that the water quality was higher at the study sites that are located above the dam reservoir based on both the chemical and biological parameters. This study also indicated that both spring and autumn constitute appropriate periods for carrying out monitoring studies. The values of multimeric index indicated the same water quality (except for site 1) in both sampling periods. Anthropogenic transformations of a riverbed influence the flora and fauna and affect the ecological status of rivers.},

abstract = {Globally, irrigated agriculture is both essential for food production and the largest user of water. A major challenge for hydrologic and agricultural research communities is assessing the sustainability of irrigated croplands under climate variability and change. Simulations of irrigated croplands generally lack key interactions between water supply, water distribution, and agricultural water demand. In this article, we explore the critical interface between water resources and agriculture by motivating, developing, and illustrating the application of an integrated modeling framework to advance simulations of irrigated croplands. We motivate the framework by examining historical dynamics of irrigation water withdrawals in the United States and quantitatively reviewing previous modeling studies of irrigated croplands with a focus on representations of water supply, agricultural water demand, and impacts on crop yields when water demand exceeds water supply. We then describe the integrated modeling framework for simulating irrigated croplands, which links trends and scenarios with water supply, water allocation, and agricultural water demand. Finally, we provide examples of efforts that leverage the framework to improve simulations of irrigated croplands as well as identify opportunities for interventions that increase agricultural productivity, resiliency, and sustainability.

abstract = {Bengaluru, widely known for its pleasant climate and IT activities, is one of the fastest growing cities of the world. It houses more than 200 lakes. Lakes are important in a city like Bengaluru which does not have a perennial river, thus is dependent on many lakes for both water supply and recreation. Water quality of these lakes is essential, as they are open spaces as well as interact with groundwater. In this study, ten lakes of three different subwatersheds—rural, semi-urban and urban were studied. Physicochemical analysis of the lakes was carried out. The water quality index was then computed using the weighted arithmetic method and overall index of pollution method. It is found that in the city of Bengaluru, urban subwatersheds host lakes of very poor water quality and need immediate attention. Also, the lakes in semi-urban watersheds must be protected to avoid further deterioration and protection of water bodies. The current study presents the lake water quality of three different types of subwatersheds and hence will be useful in understanding the effect of land use on water quality. It will be helpful for decision makers to take further action in protecting not only the land but also the water quality present in the lakes.},

abstract = {Indices developed for stream bioassessment are typically based on either fish or macroinvertebrate assemblages. These indices consist of metrics which subsume attributes of various species into aggregate measures reflecting community-level ecological responses to disturbance. However, little is known about the relationship between fish and macroinvertebrate metrics, or about how ecological health assessments are affected by assemblage-specific responses to disturbance. We used principal component analysis (PCA) and regression analysis of existing fish (n = 371) and macroinvertebrate (n = 442) stream bioassessment data from a multi-source dataset to determine broad scale, within-assemblage metric patterns, and to examine the intercorrelation of fish and macroinvertebrate metrics (n = 246) and their response to watershed area and land use/land cover gradients. Fish and macroinvertebrate metrics expressed as principal components (PCs) accounted for 72.4 and 85.4% of dataset variance, respectively, with PC-metric patterns reflecting aspects of stream impairment including water and habitat quality. Model components predicting fish metric response differed among fish PCs, with watershed area and macroinvertebrate metric response strongly correlated with the first fish PC, and remaining fish PC models consisting of watershed area, land use, and macroinvertebrate PCs. Correlation between fish and macroinvertebrate PCs, and models relating fish and macroinvertebrate PCs generally explained less variation (13-27%) than metric response models of fish (25-34%) and macroinvertebrates (8-38%) to watershed area and land use/land cover variables. Best-response models integrating fish and macroinvertebrate PCs, watershed area, and land use/land cover variables accounted for the greatest variation in fish PCs (32-50%) across sites. Because fish and macroinvertebrate metrics provide different information on ecological condition, integrated use of information from multiple groups may be appropriate when developing monitoring programs. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Analysis of lotic ecological status, as indicated by an established biotic index based primarily on benthic macroinvertebrate community structure, of 797 hydrologically independent river sites located throughout Ireland showed highly significant inverse associations between the ecological status of rivers and measures of catchment urbanisation and agricultural intensity, densities of humans and cattle and chemical indicators of water quality. Stepwise logistic regression suggested that urbanisation, arable farming and extent of pasturelands are the principal factors impacting on the ecological status of streams and rivers in Ireland and that the likelihood of a river site complying with the demands of the EU Water Framework Directive, and be of 'good' ecological status, can be predicted with reasonable accuracy using simple models that utilise either widely available landcover data or chemical monitoring data. Non-linear landcover and chemical 'thresholds' derived from these models provide a useful tool in the management of risk in catchments, and suggest strongly that more careful planning of land use in Ireland is essential in order to restore and maintain water quality as required by the Directive. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {1.Modification of natural landscapes and land-use intensification are global phenomena that can result in a range of differing pressures on lotic ecosystems. We analysed national-scale databases to quantify the relationship between three land uses (indigenous vegetation, urbanisation and agriculture) and indicators of stream ecological integrity. Boosted regression tree modelling was used to test the response of 14 indicators belonging to four groups - water quality (at 578 sites), benthic invertebrates (at 2666 sites), fish (at 6858 sites) and ecosystem processes (at 156 sites). Our aims were to characterise the ecological response curves of selected functional and structural metrics in relation to three land uses, examine the environmental moderators of these relationships and quantify the relative utility of metrics as indicators of stream ecological integrity. 2.The strongest indicators of land-use effects were nitrate+nitrite, delta-15 nitrogen value ($\delta$15N) of primary consumers and the Macroinvertebrate Community Index (a biotic index of organic pollution), while the weakest overall indicators were gross primary productivity, benthic invertebrate richness and fish richness. All indicators declined in response to removal of indigenous vegetation and urbanisation, while variable responses to agricultural intensity were observed for some indicators. 3.The response curves for several indicators suggested distinct thresholds in response to urbanisation and agriculture, specifically at 10% impervious cover and at 0.1gm-3 nitrogen concentration, respectively. 4.Water quality and ecosystem process indicators were influenced by a combination of temperature, slope and flow variables, whereas for macroinvertebrate indicators, catchment rainfall, segment slope and temperature were significant environmental predictor variables. Downstream variables (e.g. distance to the coast) were significant in explaining residual variation in fish indicators, not surprisingly given the preponderance of diadromous fish species in New Zealand waterways. The inclusion of continuous environmental variables used to develop a stream typology improved model performance more than the inclusion of stream type alone. 5.Our results reaffirm the importance of accounting for underlying spatial variation in the environment when quantifying relationships between land use and the ecological integrity of streams. Of distinctive interest, however, were the contrasting and complementary responses of different indicators of stream integrity to land use, suggesting that multiple indicators are required to identify land-use impact thresholds, develop environmental standards and assign ecological scores for reporting purposes. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

The road network is used as a proxy for the stormwater network. Two production functions, SCS (1972) and a linear reservoir, are coupled to the lag and route transfer function. Three types of land use classes are used. Tests are carried out at hourly and 5-minute time steps using both the natural and modified drainage networks. New hydrological insights for the region: Fifty-three rainfall–runoff events are monitored on the urban part of the catchment over the 2008–2018 period. The highest rainfall values are recorded in 2008/2009, while the highest peak flow values are recorded in 2017/2018. This is due to stream channelisation and increased stormwater network coverage. Using the road network with minimal land use classes improves the model performance at both the hourly and 5-minute time steps.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: A study was conducted in the Piedmont province of Maryland to determine if a relationship exists between stream quality and the extent of watershed urbanization. During the first phase of the study 27 small watersheds, having similar characteristics but varied according to land use, were investigated. Using these controlled conditions, eliminating as many interferences as possible, this first phase was intended to determine if a definite relationship did exist between the two factors. Finding that the first phase was successful the second was initiated which consisted of a comparison of biological sampling data, from other studies, with degree of watershed urbanization. The purpose of this second phase was to ascertain if the relationship between degrees of urbanization and decline in stream quality was linear as watershed area increased and in streams spread throughout the Maryland Piedmont. The principal finding of this study was that stream quality impairment is first evidenced when watershed imperviousness reaches 12%, but does not become severe until imperviousness reaches 30%.

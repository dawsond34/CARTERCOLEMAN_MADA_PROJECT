# Instructions for reproducing study:

This file contains code to clean the raw UOWN data and explore the cleaned UOWN data. Raw data is located under "raw_data" in the "data" folder. Outputs of the "processingscript" file saves a processed data set into the "processed_data" file. the "Data_Exploration" File outputs are several linear model plots and will be save in the "results" folder.

1. Start by loading and running the "processingscript.R" file in the "processing_code" file. Once your environment is up-to-date, run the "Data_Exploration.Rmd" file to reproduce the data exploration of Stream Health Indicator correlation. 

2. Once the script has been run, check the "processed_data" folder in the "data" folder to make sure the script was run correctly. These files will be basic imput for all further exploration and analysis.

3. Once the "processingscript.R" is run correctly, run the Data_exploration script. Make sure that Output are saved in the "results" folder.
